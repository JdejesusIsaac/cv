I’m Juan,  I love Basketball and Tech !
 
Basketball helped me build a skill set. My greatest ability is being able to put others in the best situation possible through studying the game. 

When I was once trash, I never took having next for granted. I've always studied my opponents and my teammates. I got better by simply studying what I lacked.
 
I got into tech with the same passion I had for basketball. I didn't skip a step and took it seriously with a Kobe  type attitude. I completed a Cyber security bootcamp with Perscholas. From there I took my talents to Blockgeeks, where I'm perfecting my craft at being an Ethereum developer.
I need some real world experience, I'm ready to put in pain with a dedicated team who love their craft as much as I do.   
 

I need some friends who share the same interest and love sports and video games  as much as me. I'm just annoying to my guys that don’t know tech. ..
